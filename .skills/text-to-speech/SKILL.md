# Text-to-Speech

## Overview

Converts text into a synthesized speech audio file using the LemonFox TTS API, with support for custom voice types and output formats. Suitable for use cases such as voice feedback in chat apps, blog narration, and video voiceovers.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Endpoint | `POST https://app-dglnmr1k1czl-api-GYX1lzGw01Xa.gateway.appmedo.com/v1/audio/speech` |
| Auth | Bearer Token (platform_managed) |
| Request Format | `application/json` |
| Response Format | Binary audio file (`application/octet-stream`) |
| Billing | Billed per request |

### Request Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `input` | `string` | Yes | The text content to convert to speech |
| `voice` | `string` | Yes | Voice type, e.g.: `heart` |
| `response_format` | `string` | No | Output audio format, e.g.: `mp3`, `wav`, `ogg` |

### Response

The endpoint directly returns **binary audio file content**, with response header `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`. There is no JSON wrapper — the response body is the audio file itself.

## Generation-time Usage (Agent Direct Call)

After calling the API, binary audio data is returned directly and must be saved to a local file.

> For complete TypeScript code and the download workflow, see the "Generation-time Usage" section in `references/speech-api.md`.

---

## Post-generation Usage (In-app via Edge Function)

In an application, requests are proxied through an Edge Function. The Edge Function stores the binary audio stream to Supabase Storage and returns a persistent public URL to the frontend.
